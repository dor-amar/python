# Indexing

### **Class Summary: Indexing**

In this class, we learned about **indexing**, a way to access individual elements in sequences like strings, lists, and tuples. In Python, indexing starts at 0, meaning the first element of a sequence has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on. We also explored **negative indexing**, which allows access to elements from the end of a sequence, with `-1` referring to the last element. Understanding indexing is essential for manipulating and accessing specific elements in sequences.

### **Exercises**

**Exercise 1: Accessing Characters in a String**

Define a string variable and print the first and last character using indexing.

**Example**:

```python
word = "Python"
first_character = word[0]
last_character = word[-1]
print(first_character)  # Output: P
print(last_character)   # Output: n

```

**Exercise 2: Slicing a String**

Create a string and print a slice from the 2nd to the 5th character (inclusive).

**Example**:

```python
text = "Programming"
substring = text[1:5]
print(substring)  # Output: rogr

```

**Exercise 3: Negative Indexing**

Define a string and print the second-to-last character using negative indexing.

**Example**:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"
second_to_last = message[-2]
print(second_to_last)  # Output: d

```

**Exercise 4: Extracting a Substring with Negative Indexing**

Create a string and print a substring using negative indexing, starting from the third-to-last character to the last character.

**Example**:

```python
phrase = "Learning Python"
substring = phrase[-3:]
print(substring)  # Output: hon

```

**Exercise 5: Combining Slicing and Concatenation**

Define a string and create a new string by slicing the first half and the second half, then concatenating them in reverse order.

**Example**:

```python
text = "abcdefgh"
half_length = len(text) // 2
first_half = text[:half_length]
second_half = text[half_length:]
new_string = second_half + first_half
print(new_string)  # Output: efghabcd

```
