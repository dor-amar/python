# String Exercises

In this class, we learned about strings, which are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. We explored how to create strings, concatenate them, and use common string methods. We also covered how to access specific characters in a string using indexing and how to extract parts of a string using slicing. Additionally, we learned about various string methods like upper(), lower(), replace(), and count(), which help manipulate and work with strings effectively.


### **Exercise 1: Concatenate Strings**

Create two string variables, concatenate them, and print the result.

**Example**:

```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)  # Output: Hello World

```

### **Exercise 2: Extract and Print Substring**

Define a string variable and print a substring from it.

**Example**:

```python
text = "Python Programming"
substring = text[7:18]
print(substring)  # Output: Programming

```

### **Exercise 3: Count Characters**

Define a string and print the number of times a specific character appears in it.

**Example**:

```python
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
count = sentence.count('o')
print(count)  # Output: 4

```

### **Exercise 4: Replace a Word in a String**

Create a string and replace a word in it with another word. Print the new string.

**Example**:

```python
sentence = "I enjoy coding in Java."
new_sentence = sentence.replace("Java", "Python")
print(new_sentence)  # Output: I enjoy coding in Python.

```

### **Exercise 5: String to Uppercase and Lowercase**

Define a string and print it in both uppercase and lowercase.

**Example**:

```python
message = "Learning Python is fun!"
uppercase_message = message.upper()
lowercase_message = message.lower()
print(uppercase_message)  # Output: LEARNING PYTHON IS FUN!
print(lowercase_message)  # Output: learning python is fun!

```
