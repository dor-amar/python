# Numbers 

### **Class Summary: Working with Numbers**

In this class, we covered **numbers** in Python, including **integers** and **floats**. We discussed how to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. We also explored how to convert between different numeric types (integers and floats) and how to round numbers. Understanding how to work with numbers is essential for performing calculations and managing numeric data in programs.

### **Exercises**

**Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic**

Define two integer variables and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.

**Example**:

```python
pythonCopy code
a = 8
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 11
print(a - b)  # Output: 5
print(a * b)  # Output: 24
print(a / b)  # Output: 2.6666666666666665

```

**Exercise 2: Modulus and Exponentiation**

Using two numbers, calculate the modulus and exponentiation. Print the results.

**Example**:

```python
pythonCopy code
x = 10
y = 2
print(x % y)  # Output: 0
print(x ** y) # Output: 100

```

**Exercise 3: Rounding a Float**

Define a float variable and print its value rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Example**:

```python
pythonCopy code
pi = 3.14159
rounded_pi = round(pi, 2)
print(rounded_pi)  # Output: 3.14

```

**Exercise 4: Integer and Float Conversion**

Convert an integer to a float and a float to an integer. Print the results.

**Example**:

```python
pythonCopy code
integer_number = 7
float_number = float(integer_number)
print(float_number)  # Output: 7.0

decimal_number = 9.8
integer_number = int(decimal_number)
print(integer_number)  # Output: 9

```

**Exercise 5: Combining Numbers with Strings**

Define an integer and a float. Convert them to strings and concatenate with another string. Print the final result.

**Example**:

```python
pythonCopy code
age = 25
height = 5.9
message = "I am " + str(age) + " years old and " + str(height) + " feet tall."
print(message)  # Output: I am 25 years old and 5.9 feet tall.

```
